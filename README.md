# GANspace + PPBO project



## Idea

Probabilistic Interactive User Model for Interactive AI

Based on 2 projects:
- GANSpace
- Projective Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PPBO)

**Idea Formulation:** Adjust image generation model (GAN) to follow userâ€™s preferences using Bayesian Optimization.

## Set Up

1. Install anaconda or miniconda
2. Create environment: `conda create -n ganppbo python=3.7`
3. Activate environment: `conda activate ganppbo`
4. Open project directory: `cd GANPPBO`
5. Install dependencies: `conda env update -f environment.yml --prune`
6. Activate widget extension: `jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension`

## Original project info

Currently, the code of both projects is committed to this repository. 
Later ganspace is going to be transformed into submodule. 
PPBO will stay a part of this code since it was changed.
